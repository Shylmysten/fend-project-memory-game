# (FEND) Memory Game Project
*by **Tony Boswell***


## Forward

I utilized the starter project code that had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted this static project into an interactive one following the Guidelines and the project Rubric to the best of my ability, taking a few liberties at improvisation with some of my own ideas. It required patience, attention to detail and a love for what I am doing.
