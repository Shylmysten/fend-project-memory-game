# (FEND) Memory Game Project
*by **Tony Boswell***


## Forward

I utilized the starter project code that had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. It was forked from [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game). I converted this static project into an interactive game, following the Guidelines in the project Rubric to the best of my ability, and utilizing the videos in the Udacity Classroom to base the game animations from. I took very few liberties at improvisation or changing the UI of that game as it was presented in the starter file. I wanted to see if I could actually build something from just a mockup and an example of how the game worked. It required patience, attention to detail and a love for what I am doing. Overall, it was a really fun project!!

## How To Play

Simply point your browser to https://shylmysten.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/

 - A game clock will begin when the first card is clicked.
 - Each click costs one move.
 - Every card has one matching card.
 - Clicking on the cards will reveal them.
 - Find two cards that match and they will remain turned over.
 - If you click on two cards and they don't match, no worries, they will turn back over automatically.

 The object is to get all the cards matched in as few moves as possible, and as quickly as possible.
**Good Luck!**
